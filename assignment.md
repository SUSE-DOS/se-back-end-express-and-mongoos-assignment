![assignment](https://github.com/SkillsUnion/se-back-end-express-and-mongoose/blob/main/assets/images/assignment.png)

You are tasked with creating a simple student portal that will allow students to check their grades online using their student number and a pin number allocated to them by the administration. The administration at the university is in a hurry as exams are around the corner so they'd like to have ta demo of the grade portal up and running soon!

Replicate all the steps in this series to create a form that takes a student number and student pin (all hard coded) and route the user to a page where the studentâ€™s grades are shown. Since this is a demo you need not worry about saving user input from the form into a MongoDB collection as yet.
